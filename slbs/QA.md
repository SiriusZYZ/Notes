# self-introduction

Hi, interviewer! It's my pleasure to take part in today's interview.
My name is Zhou Yinze. I am currently studying as a postgraduate student in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China , and I am about to graduate in twenty-twenty-four. 
My major is electronic information, which is pretty much generalized. What I'm actually studying is the application of distributed fiber optic sensing in oilfield monitoring and production optimization.   
During these year of study, I have many opportunities to combine petroleum science and information technology in my research, including parameters adjusting, modeling, visualization, inversion, and so on. I also have several project experience which are related to software development.
I knew slb when I was the T.A. of my supervisor lecture, and joined the intern day event two weeks ago. And found myself very interested in the position of software engineering. Therefore, I am applying this position.
That's all of my introduction.
# SLB background

## What do you know about SLB?
- Background:
  1. founded by Schlumberger Brothers, in 20
- Business scope
  1. **Conventional** Oilfield service:  from: 
     - **突出一个全周期**
     - exploration
     - drill
     - completion
     - field test
     - optimization
  2. 
- Why so success?
  1. the cutting edge technology
  2. 
## how do you know SLB?
- back in twenty twenty-two, I was the TA of my professor. He was teaching a lesson called Exploration Technology and Engineering. In a certain lesson, he mentioned the resistivity logging, and Schlumberger's Brothers. After the class, he sent an article regarding to slb, and I found out slb is actually the biggest oil field service company in the world.
- Later on, one of the engineer of slb came to our school to give a lecture. Her name is Tianhua as I recall. Her lecture was about the oil field service industry, and focused on slb's pivot. And by then I knew the Beijing Geoscience Center of slb, and your digitalization and decarbonization business. 
- In August, I came to Beijing to participate in the Inter Day Event, then I understand SLB better. 
## Why SLB?
There are some certain aspects when I wanna decide which company suit me most.
1. The first thing would be the position of the company in the industry. SLB is the biggest company in oil field service. During the Inter day event, I got to know that SLB's decarbonization business in Europe is massive. So you are not merely focusing on the petroleum, which is nice. These would be the guarantee of a secure job, as the company would gain enough profit to sustain its R&D department. 
2. The Second one would be the job itself. I am applying for the software engineering, which is the job I always dream of. I like coding, implementing stuff and find out how to optimize them. I learned that in BGC, people cares about techs and there are a lot of competition, Hackathons for example. 
3. Then I also want to check the platform and how it may impact my whole career planning. So during the Intern Day, I got to know that you guys have a concept of " borderless-career". It's possible to explore different positions when you are at SLB. And SLB provide comprehensive trainings to help you pivot, which is great. 
4. The third thing would be the company's culture, and I think that is what I love SLB a lot. 
   - SLB cares about safety of its employees. You have rigorous safety protocols for field engineers and mechanics engineers , you have safety training for personnel who work in the office and so on. But I want to mention something that touch me a lot.  I read an article about the first aid day on your WeChat public account. It's about CPR and AED equipment training,  what to do when someone is choking, and other first aid knowledge. I was really impressed because I always want to learn how to properly perform the CPR back in the school. But they never open a lecture for first aid and that's a pity.
  - SLB also have a diverse and inclusive culture. Which means one can learn a lot from others with different background. And I think that would benefit in both the professional way and the daily life way. 
  - And I found people in SLB have a sense of ownership. In the propaganda video clip, I learned that some of your products fancy features are origin from the employees' inspiration. At first, it was those software engineers who came up with some new idea and try to demonstrate on some kind of innovation competition. Then SLB found it plausible and decided to integrate them into the products as a new feature. Which i guess, would give those engineer a sense of achievement and ownership of SLB.

# Project Experience

## Borehole acoustic evaluation project.

 - a consignment from an state-owned oil filed company. 
 - determine the data quality of borehole acoustic instrument
 - a team of 8 ppl
   1. Matlab 2, which is the original implementation of the algorithms 
   2. rest of us : Cpp
 - Why CPP: these state-owned company wants to guarantee their software products would not contain any incontrollable foreign tech, matlab for example.
 - We need to port every functions the Matlab crew wrote, along with the some of the Matlab built-in functions.
 - among them, there is a function called vmd, which is the variational mode decomposition, and it has been called by more than 20 other function, which makes it vital for the whole project.
 - Process:
   1. At first I want to get the Matlab source code of it, but failed. 
   2. Then i turn to the academic society, and found out that vmd was introduced in 2014 in an IEEE paper. In this paper, the authors attached the original source code of vmd in Matlab. And the script is open-source with an MIT license.  
   3. The first thought come to my head was translating them as usual, but then i think why dont i look it up on github, see if anyone has implement it using cpp. And I did find one, the code was published by a guy called Hugo, he mentioned his implementation was somehow, slow and laggy.
   4. So I tested that code, and found out that it took up too much memory, we were seeing an consumption of up to 4 giga bytes. which is totally unacceptable. But, still the answer is correct.
   5. So there must be some kind of problem with the code. Maybe it doesn't free a pointer, or duplicate something repeatedly. To address the problem, I read the code very carefully (Both the original Matlab code and the Hugo's implementation) and found the problem. 
   6. Vmd is done by iteration to minimize a certain loss function. And each iteration would takes the result of last iteration as part of the input. The result we are talking about is an array, which has the same size as the signal to be decomposed.
   7. So if you want to save results of all the iteration for debugging, and your input is so long. That would be a huge problem. And this is the feature of the original Matlab code, and so does Hugo's code. Maybe he didn't notice that when he was porting from Matlab.
   8. So the solution is clear and simple. As the iteration only use the result of last iteration, we only keep the last one. When the new result comes out, we override the last result. By doing this, we can save a huge space, the times we save is depend on how many iteration are done in the process. And in some cases, we are seeing a reduction of memory usage by more than 100 times.
   9. After I refactored the code, the problem was solved. And I also publish it on github if someone need it.

### 面波


- vawt(): variable area wiggle trace 变面积摆动轨迹图

### MASW多道面波分析
- multi-channel analysis surface wave
假设面波信号为
$$\begin{align} f(x, t) & = cos(\omega_0 t -k_0x) \\& = cos\left[\omega_0 (t-k_0/\omega_0 x)\right]\\ &=cos\left[\omega_0(t-1/c_0 x)\right] \end{align}$$
对面波信号做傅里叶变化：
$$F(x, \omega)= \pi[\delta(\omega-\omega_0) + \delta(\omega+\omega_0)]e^{-j\frac{1}{c_0}x}$$
求相位信息:
$$\begin{align}P(x, \omega) &= \frac{F(x, \omega)}{\left|F(x, \omega) \right|} \\
&= e^{-j\frac{1}{c_0}x} \end{align}$$
我们进行给定一个面波速度$c$ 进行扫描，将其造成的时延放到$P(x, \omega)$ 相位信息中
$$\begin{align}P_x(c, \omega) 
&= P(x, \omega) \times e^{j\frac{1}{c}x} \\
&= e^{-j \left(\frac{1}{c_0} - \frac{1}{c}\right)x}
\end{align}$$
在多道信号中，假设$x$ 序列为$\{x_1, ... x_n\}$， 如果我们对所有的序列进行扫描，可以得到，求和后取其幅值:
$$\begin{align} MASW(c) &= \left|\sum^n_{i = 0}P_x(c, \omega)\right| \\
&= \left|\sum^n_{i=0} e^{-j \left(\frac{1}{c_0} - \frac{1}{c}\right)x_i}\right| \end{align}$$
易知$\left(\frac{1}{c_0} - \frac{1}{c}\right) \to 0$ 时，$MASW(c)$ 取得最大值。通过选取不同的c来计算MASW可，求得一极值可以得到某一面波速度。

## 频散曲线正演

- disba : 第三方库，用于输入速度模型计算频散曲线，输入包括p波速度和s波速度，层厚和密度

### GA遗传算法

- why GA： 从论文上看的，就是说频散曲线反演是个非线性问题，解的域连续非离散，而GA适合解决这个问题
- 整个流程就是：评分->交叉->小概率变异->评分->... 

- 求解
- 群体：可行解的集合()
- 适应度函数：相当于损失函数的反义词
- 交叉：选取适应度高的解，让这些解互相交换一部分参数
- 变异：对交换以后的解引入一定的随机，变异可能引入优势也可能引入劣势，因此**只能小概率**进行
- 无改进空间：指连续多次的适应度函数的区间不再显著变化

# Highlights
## Python and C++

> What are the differences between cpp and Python?
> 1. **Syntax**: **Static Type vs Dynamic Type**. I would say Python is more flexible, and could do more in generic programming.
> 2. **Performance**: **Python is based on C**. The scripts need to be translated to C and then compile. cpp can just compile and run. So cpp and C is relatively faster than Python.
> 3. **Memory Management:** **manual or automatic** 
>    - cpp manual management: manually allocate and release 
>    - Python automatic management
> 4. **Community:** Both have active community.
> personally, I think Python is more suitable for validate your idea. We have a vast variety of libraries to use, and you don't need to build an existing wheel. But when speaking of implementation, Cpp should be a better option. We want the code running in relatively high speed.

# Interests

- I like reading. I read 30 books last year, including psychology, history, fiction, and other stuff.
- I like photography. I have two camera, one is digital and the other is a film camera. I take pictures and make photography books. I also have a free-lance position at the school affiliated workshop. 
- I like drawing. My mom work in the traditional art industry, so she signed me up for some art related lesson when I was little and encourage me to take drawing and painting as a relish of daily life.
- I also make cocktails. I am the bartender of the workshop, when there is a party, I would be the one who shaking spirit and waving the bar spoon. But, you know, It's just a hobby so I am an amateur.
- (Optional) I also translate the memes from twitter and Instagram. As they are funny and sometime inspiring.


- Actually, I found most of my interest, including programing, are those you can improve through practice and retrospect. But the difference are photograph, painting, cocktails making are those more palpable by your own sensation. 
- Normally, Before the cocktail party, I would search some new recipes on a website. The recipes may fits the author's taste, but not everyone's taste. I made a cocktail called silk stocking, its spirit is tequila according to the original recipe. But my friends and I found that tequila gave you a weird herbal aftertaste, while the cocktail is meant to be taste like cacao. So it's kind of off balance. The problem is the spirit, I first change it to Vodka, that's better, but not satisfying enough. Then I change to light rum, and the taste started to make sense. And my friend love it very much.
- The point is dare to change or discover.

- somehow I finds the things I like contains a lot of "what if" questions. Like what if I tune the shadow and the brightness, will that make any difference on the sensation that my photo or paintings conveyed to my readers? Or what if I add more single cream in the recipe, how may it change the taste of a certain cocktail? I mean regarding to these interest, including programming, theory is important, but practice is the essential part of all. Only by fine tuning the process you can actually make your work, or your code better.

# Questions for slb


- ==**Probation time**==: I want to know how long is the probation, and the difference between probation and formally employment.
- ==Question about association Program==:To my knowledge, the association program would last for 6 months, in this program we would learn thing including front end, back end, QA, DevOps etc. Which is great. 
  1. I want to know, during this period of time, will there be any formal assignment or it would be a time we freshman just learn stuff and take the test?
  2. Another thing I want to know is how SLB decides which candidates would be in which position. According to the job description,  software engineering is a little bit vague on what this job is  actually about. Will that process take the candidates' will into consideration, or that performance would be the determent?
- **==Performance==**: During the Intern Day, one of your HR mentioned that, in SLB, "you promote yourself". Would you be kind enough to tell me the details ?












- In the intern day, I learned that each freshman should attend an Association Program, and then would be assigned to different positions. Can you tell me more about this process? Especially on how does slb decide which person would go to which department.
- will there be a mentor to guide you through the program and the following job?
- what is the daily routine of different kind of job, backend for example?
- how will ones' performance be evaluated?
- How does slb promote its employees? 
- how long is the probation?
