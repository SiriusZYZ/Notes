# Highlights
## Python and C++

> What are the differences between Cpp and Python?
> 1. **Syntax**: **Static Type vs Dynamic Type**. i would say Python is more flexible, and could do more in generic programming.
> 2. **Performance**: **Python is based on C**. The scripts need to be translated to C and then compile. Cpp can just compile and run. So Cpp and C is relatively faster than Python.
> 3. **Memory Management:** **manual or automatic** 
>    - Cpp manual management: manually allocate and release 
>    - Python automatic management
> 4. **Community:** Both have active community.
> personally, I think Python is more suitable for validate your idea. We have a vast variety of libraries to use, and you don't need to build an existing wheel. But when speaking of implementation, Cpp should be a better option. We want the code running in relatively high speed.
